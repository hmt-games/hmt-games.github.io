Welcome to the second Dice Adventure Human-AI Teaming Competition! We ran the first iteration of the competition in 2024 as one of the game-AI competitions hosted at 2024 [Conference on Games](https://2024.ieee-cog.org/) and we are returning this year. In this competition, we are using an in-house developed game called Dice Adventure as the environment and encourage participants to explore human-AI teaming effects. Dice Adventure is a multi-player turn-based dungeon crawling game that takes three players to play. Detailed information on game rules, game tutorial and frequently asked questions can be found at [Game](game.markdown) page.

We offer two tracks and welcome participantas at all levels. To participate, you must sign up for one or both track(s). If you are interested in developing an agent, please check out the guidelines in [Submit AI](submission.markdown) page for *agent development track*. The starter code and training environment can be accessed at the [Dice-Adventure-Agents](https://github.com/STRONG-TACT/Dice-Adventure-Agents) repo on GitHub. If you do not wish to submit an agent but are still interested in this competition, please check out the details on the [Play](/play/) page for signing up as a player in the *player track*. We will be hosting a few virtual and in-person matchmaking events to bring players together.

<!-- As part of the match-making events, we will be hosting an in-person hackathon event at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA in the United States. The hackathon is a free event that welcomes students, researchers, developers and anyone interested in our game and competition to get together. We will be organizing a series of tutorial sessions, interactive demos, working sessions and game tournaments during the two-day event. RSVP information, event schedule and accommodation suggestions can be found at the [Hackathon](/hackathon/) page. -->

The following video provides an overview to the competition tracks, rules, short game tutorial and information on setting up the training environment. We hope to bring exciting experiences to the participants and exploring critical human-AI teaming questions to gain a better understanding in team communication, coordination, and adaptation.

## Evaluation Criteria

As the goal of the competition is to better understand human-AI teaming dynamics, the submitted agents will not be evaluated by running against benchmarks or through bot fight. All the agents will be selected at least once and play with players in the player track as a team. Below are the scoring function showing how a team score is calculated. The score consists of a base score with a decaying factor and bonuses for each character. For each level, each character gets a bonous of 10 and they lose the bonus proportional to losing the health. If a character lose all the health in a level, it will not be eligible for the bonus.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;team\_score = \sum_{i=1}^{n}S_i" title="\Large team\_score = \sum_{i=1}^{n}S_i"/>

- d: decaying factor, we are using d=0.95 for competitions
- i: the current level the team is at
- j=(1, 2, 3) representing each of the three characters
- r: the number of rounds the team took to clear a level
- rs: if a character lose all lives (rs=0) in a level 
- h: the health a character remains
- h_max: the maximum health a character has
- n: the total number of levels the team has cleard


## Prizes

<!-- Dice Adventure is a multi-player, turn-based, dungeon crawling adventure game developed at Carnegie Mellon University. This is the first time for us to host the Dice Adventure Human-AI teaming competition. There are two tracks of the competition - (1) participants can submit their agents to the agent track;  (2) participants can play with other players and submitted agents in the player track. Agents submitted to the agent track will play with players in the player track and be evaluated on the team score they achieved after running multiple levels of games. Winners will be declared based on overall teaming performance. We hope to bring exciting experiences to the participants as well as exploring critical human-AI teaming questions and gain a better understanding in team communication, coordination and adaptation. An introduction of the competition can be found in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvV_hTAYgy4). -->
